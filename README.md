# IrrigationClassification

Included is a draft of my report and my code, as of April 19th, 2024, for Cornell's Engineering Learning Initiatives (ELI) Presentation.

Excitingly, this project is not close to done! Come back if you're interested. I'll keep this updated.

Here is my irrigation classifier in Google Earth Engine: https://code.earthengine.google.com/f0e0a4ca83764992fa689d4b57264c9b

Find the Jupyter Notebook code above for SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis.
